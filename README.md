# dynamic-marquee-playground

This is the docs, demo and playground site for the [vue-dynamic-marquee](https://github.com/YishaiBerg/vue-dynamic-marquee) package. Built with the awesome [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com) library (so grateful!).
I whipped this site up quite quickly, so not exceptionally proud of the code, could definitly do with refactoring and tests. All is open source so any improvments (including design) are welcome!
